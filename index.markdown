        <p class="index-intro"> Hello there, my name is Steven, and welcome to my site. This site is dedicated to documenting my coding journey in Python and dabbling into learning new technologies. Should you find yourself here, I hope I provide some useful information that can help you solve a problem, or help point you to the right direction.</p>
        <p class="index-intro">A little about myself, I switched careers from working in Broadcast/TV as an Audio Engineer to IT in 2019. Since then, I have obtained some recognizable IT certifications like the CCNA, AWS-Solutions Architect, and Security+. Along the way, I was fascinated with various concepts that are leveraged by information technology systems - like automating networks and cloud infrastructures to provide robust and resilient systems. I am working towards building up my toolbox with new skills. Either way - coding, cloud, and networks fascinate me and I hope to build some cool stuff in the near future. Cheers! </p>
